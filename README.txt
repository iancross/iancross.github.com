This is frogger image rendering assignment.

Part one was simply using the canvas and adding sprites.

UPDATED FROGGER
-------------------------------------------------------
Part one of the frogger assignment has been updated to include the fully functional frogger game.
This includes directional key movement, animation, sound effects, and scoring.

For the additional requirements in order to get an A on this assignment, I did 3 additional options.
	a. I implemented the random fly
	b. added sound effects
	c. implemented level progression with faster logs and vehicles and increased point_increment

Collaborated with Emmett Moore on design aspects and bug checking.

Spent approx 12 hours on this assignment.


Note: it seems that the sounds don't work on Chrome for some reason but it works perfectly in Safari 
and using Coda.
