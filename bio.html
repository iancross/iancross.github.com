Thanks for visiting my online portfolio! My name is Ian Cross, and I'm a computer science
major at Tufts University with an additional spanish
concentration. I was born outside of Philadelphia but grew up and spent the 
majority of my life living in North Dakota. <br>
<br>
Coming to Tufts, I had no idea what I wanted to study. I eventually took an intro to 
computer science class, and fell in love. I take great pleasure and pride in working on my
comp sci projects. Additionally, I enjoy taking Spanish language and culture classes here at
tufts.<br>
<br>
When I'm not working on working on schoolwork, I love to spend time outdoors. I hike, bike, rock climb,
snowboard, snowshoe, play soccer, and basically anything that has to do with outside. <br>
<br>
Thanks again for checking out my portfolio. Please contact me for information! <br>
